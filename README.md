# Memory Game
This memory game is a milestone project, and a part of Full Stack Software Development program, which summarizes
Interactive Frontend Development module provided by Code Institute, an educational platform used by Canadian Business College.
It was created to help you improve your memory while having fun.

## UX
An inspiration for this project comes from a game I found on memozor.com, a free memory games website, where you can find a big variety of memory games with different styles.

I waned my game to be custom, so I decreased the quantity of numbers from 30 to 9 and added a Start button that starts the game.
The design of this game is very simple and user intuitive, which makes it easy to start playing right away.

## Testing
Most of the testing was made manually using Google Chrome Inspect tool. To make sure the site is responsive and working properly. I’ve done all possible actions on all types of available devices. All elements are working as they are expected.<br/>
Special thanks to http://ami.responsivedesign.is/ where I checked responsiveness on different types of devices.

CSS code was checked with [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) and no errors were found.<br/>
HTML code was checked with [HTML Validator]( https://validator.w3.org/nu/) and the only warning I’ve got was “Section lacks heading” which we can ignore as it’s not a significant detail and doesn’t affect our website in any way.
