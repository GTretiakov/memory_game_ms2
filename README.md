# Memory Game
This memory game is a milestone project, and a part of Full Stack Software Development program, which summarizes
Interactive Frontend Development module provided by Code Institute, an educational platform used by Canadian Business College.
It was created to help you improve your memory while having fun.

## UX
An inspiration for this project comes from a game I found on memozor.com, a free memory games website, where you can find a big variety of memory games with different styles.

I waned my game to be custom, so I decreased the quantity of numbers from 30 to 9 and added a Start button that starts the game.
The design of this game is very simple and user intuitive, which makes it easy to start playing right away.

The result of my work is very close to the original wireframe:
