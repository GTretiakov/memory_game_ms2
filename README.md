# Memory Game
This memory game is a milestone project, and a part of Full Stack Software Development program, which summarizes
Interactive Frontend Development module provided by Code Institute, an educational platform used by Canadian Business College.
It was created to help you improve your memory while having fun.

## UX
An ispiration for this project comes from a game I found on memozor.com, a free memory games website, where you can find a big variety of memory gemes with different styles.
